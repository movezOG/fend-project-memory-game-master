# How the game was built 
- I manipulated the DOM in JS, altered part of the HTML and also styled the game in CSS
- Created a list that holds all of your cards
- Created a deck of cards that shuffles when game is refreshed
- Created a counter to count the number of moves made by player and timer to know the duration of a play
- Added effects to cards when they match and are unmatched
- Create a pop-up modal when player wins game
